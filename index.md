# What is MY-SERVE for BAME?

MY-SERVE stands for <b>M</b>ental health in <b>Y</b>outh: <b>SERV</b>ice <b>E</b>ffectiveness. 

Research indicates that compared to White students, BAME students may encounter more identity crises, social distress, and marginalisation (Arday, 2018), which can uniquely impact their mental health and engagement with counselling services. For example, BAME students are often reluctant to seek counselling due to fears of social stigma (Maeshima et al., 2020) or concerns about facing further racial discrimination (Equality Challenge Unit, 2015). This study aims to understand the BAME postgraduate students and staffs’ experiences of mental health service. We want to explore the specific challenges they encounter when seeking mental health services, including the University Counselling Service (UCS).

# We would like to invite you to take part if you:

* Be a postgraduate student or staff at the University of Cambridge
* Be under age 25
* Identify as an ethnic minority
* Have been seen by any mental health services (MHS) in the community
  - e.g., University Counselling Services, GP counsellor, charity or specialist MHS

# What will happen to me if I take part?

We will arrange a day and time that’s suitable for you, and the interview can be either online or face-to-face at the university. 
<b>If you are happy to go ahead with the interview, you will need to sign a consent form. </b>

We will record our conversation so that we can remember everything we talked about. The recording will only be accessible by the research team. 
The interview will take <b>up to an hour</b>. We will listen to everything you have to say, and be sensitive to how you are feeling. 

# What do I have to do?
The interview will be conducted by a member of the research team. We will let you know the type of things we will ask you beforehand so you know what to expect. We are interested in your personal experiences related to the mental health services you’ve used. 

# Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?
All information we collect about you will be kept confidential. We will not share the names of anyone who is taking part in this study with anyone outside of the research group, and we will not link your name to any information you provide. The findings may be used in presentations, academic articles and reports, but you or those you mention will not be identified in any way. 

The only exception to this will be if you tell us something that suggests a serious risk to any person (including yourself). At that point, for safety reasons, we will share this information with appropriate services, but if possible, we will try to let you know first.  For example, if you tell us something that makes us worried about your wellbeing, we will contact your school to offer further support and where appropriate share this information with safeguarding services.

# Are there any advantages or disadvantages of taking part?
While some people do find it helpful to talk about their experiences, you may find it distressing. It is important to remember you do not have to continue with the interview if you do not want to and you do not have to talk about anything that you find uncomfortable or upsetting. The researchers will provide you with details of relevant services and organisations that can offer support or help should you feel you need to talk to someone after taking part in an interview.

We can give you a £20 in Amazon voucher as a thank you for taking part in an interview.
